# Manipulating fastas is a user-friendly tutorial

This set of scripts was prepared to have students that are just learning python to hit the ground running in their research.

It is organized in multiple directories to make it easier to understand and visualize the steps and outputs of each script.

First we download data of interst from GenBank, then we have examples of a set of manipulations that can be done to make fasta files with the genes and species of interest.

__Happy coding!__
